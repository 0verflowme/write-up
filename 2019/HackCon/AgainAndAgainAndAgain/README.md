#### Observation

The flag was encrypted by [Rabin cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin_cryptosystem) for multiple times. Since the factor `p` and `q` were given, I directly apply [extended euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm) and [chinese remainder theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem) to find the four candidates(`r`, `s`, `n - r`, `n - s`) of plaintext.

Obviously the actual flag must be printable. By using this criteria which the plaintext must satisfy, I performed a [breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) to find the flag. Each stage generated four candidates of plaintext, so BFS implementation was necessary.

The modular square root algorithm is obtained from [here](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/03/07/computing-modular-square-roots-in-python).

I get the flag:

```
